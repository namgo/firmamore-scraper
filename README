This is a bad copy of firmadyne's scraper because initially I wanted to use s3 and couldn't figure out how to do it.

I still can't use S3 with DO using scrapy but at least it downloads things properly.

send.py polls output/linksys/* and sends everything to an s3 bucket

Over time I'm hoping to be able to expand on Firmadyne's project with more static analysis of binaries contained in the firmwares this pulls.
